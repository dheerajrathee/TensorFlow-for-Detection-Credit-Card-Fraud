# Application of TensorFlow for detection of Credit-Card Fraud

## Project: 
To learn and depoy TensorFlow deep learning framework for an financial data analysis application. 

## Dataset:

The dataset we’re going to use can be downloaded from <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud" target="_blank">Kaggle</a>     . It contains data about credit card transactions that occurred during a period of two days, with 492 frauds out of 284,807 transactions.

All variables in the dataset are numerical. The data has been transformed using PCA transformation(s) due to privacy reasons. The two features that haven’t been changed are Time and Amount. Time contains the seconds elapsed between each transaction and the first transaction in the dataset.

The datasets contains transactions made by credit cards in September 2013 by european cardholders.
This dataset presents transactions that occurred in two days, where we have 492 frauds out of 284,807 transactions. The dataset is highly unbalanced, the positive class (frauds) account for 0.172% of all transactions.

It contains only numerical input variables which are the result of a PCA transformation. Unfortunately, due to confidentiality issues, we cannot provide the original features and more background information about the data. Features V1, V2, … V28 are the principal components obtained with PCA, the only features which have not been transformed with PCA are 'Time' and 'Amount'. Feature 'Time' contains the seconds elapsed between each transaction and the first transaction in the dataset. The feature 'Amount' is the transaction Amount, this feature can be used for example-dependant cost-senstive learning. Feature 'Class' is the response variable and it takes value 1 in case of fraud and 0 otherwise.

## Learning:
- Pandas DataFrame Manipulations
- Basic Pythonic Scripting
- Appropriate data types (e.g. strings, floats) and data structures (e.g. lists, dictionaries) are chosen to carry out the required analysis tasks.
- Raw input is solicited and handled correctly to guide the interactive question-answering experience; no errors are thrown when unexpected input is entered.
- Descriptive statistics are correctly computed and used to answer the questions posed about the data. Raw data is displayed upon request by the user.
